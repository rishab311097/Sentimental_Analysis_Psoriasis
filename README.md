# Sentimental_Analysis_Psoriasis
We started the analysis with a preconceived notion that people are mean to other people 
suffering from Psoriasis. The sentiment analysis we performed on Twitter data has proven to 
be extremely useful in gaining an overview of the wider public opinion behind Psoriasis. The 
data that we collected from Twitter.com and Drug.com explains some part of our
understanding before analysing it. After analysing the data, we could see a lot of positive 
comments being shared on the social media, most of them were self-narratives of struggle 
and fight against the disease. The negative tweets were majorly concentrated towards the 
pain people suffer, the anxiety of looking good or the medication not working and so on. 
The data about the various drugs in use by people in respect to Psoriasis was more or less 
neutral (from a holistic point of view). In-depth analysis of the same gave us insights that they 
were neutral as people started off with a positive / negative narrative and then deviated to 
the opposite sentiment making the entire review classified as neutral. The Pie charts plotted 
for just the negative and the positive sentiments showed us that most drugs had mixed 
reaction i.e., had positive and negative reviews in approximately the same proportion. 
We observed that Otezla and Amgen were 2 companies which were positively spoken about 
in the tweets. Clobetasol, Cosentyx, Remicade were the drugs that had greater positive 
feedback, with Remicade having the highest positive sentimental reviews (83.91%). Making 
Johnson and Johnson Inc. the most trusted drug manufacturing company for Psoriasis.
Even though our model worked well and was able to classify the sentiments correctly for the 
tweets and the reviews, due to lack of data, our insights are very specific to the dataset and 
does not capture the general perspective of people. Future work like tokenization of the 
dataset after capturing the sentiments can now be used to classify the data directly using any 
machine learning models, without the help of NLTK package. 
Our analysis can help companies understand what are the various factors that affect people 
the most in respect to Psoriasis, so that they can address those concerns in a better way. The 
drug review analysis can help drug manufacturing companies understand the sentiment of 
people towards their drug and, can help them improve their drug to have a larger customer 
base.
